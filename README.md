# fourier-prediction
To reproduce the synthetic experiments adjust the parameters in synthetic_signal_test.py and run it. The results may be plotted by using synthetic_signal_plot.py
after adjusting the logfile path in that file.

To run the power prediction experiments download:

And extract it in the power experiments folder. Then run power_load_pred_exp 
with the desired parameters.

The experiments in music_exp and human motion exp where not too promising.
